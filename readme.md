🌱 EasFarm – A One-Stop Solution for Farmers

        EasFarm is a digital platform built to empower farmers by connecting them with manufacturers, suppliers, and machine owners (like tractors and harvesters).
        Our mission is to provide transparency, accessibility, and fairness in agriculture-related services and products.

🚜 Why EasFarm?

    In India, farmers often face challenges in connecting with manufacturers, suppliers, and machine owners (like tractors and harvesters). Many times, they also get overcharged due to lack of transparency.



👉 EasFarm solves this by creating a direct bridge between farmers and product/service providers.
