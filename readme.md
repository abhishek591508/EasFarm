🌱 EasFarm – A One-Stop Solution for Farmers

        EasFarm is a digital platform built to empower farmers by connecting them with manufacturers, suppliers, and machine owners (like tractors and harvesters).
        Our mission is to provide transparency, accessibility, and fairness in agriculture-related services and products.

🚜 Why EasFarm?
